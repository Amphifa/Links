**To take away the human scent from whatever I do, I make a scent-masking bath as follows:**
First, take:
	• 2lbs MALE cedar branches
	• 2lbs balsam branches
	• 1lb. Hen manure
Chop the branches fine, place the whole in a pot in 2 gallons of soft water - "fresh rain water is best" - and boil until reduced to 1 1/2 gallon.
Second, take a clean pail or tub, smoke it with birch or balsam bark, then place the solution (above) inside, cover, and keep in a temperate place.

**Spontaneous Combustion**
We often hear of fires apparently "starting themselves." Such cases are due to accumulation of heat produced by slow oxidation. 
If a pile of oily rags, cotton waste, etc., be allowed to stand for a time, the oily matter will begin to combine slowly with oxygen.
This may occur in the inner part of the heap, and the outer layers retain the heat until, perhaps, the kindling point of some of the inflammable oils is reached, when the whole mass will burst into flame. 
This is much more likely to happen with linseed oil and certain other vegetable "drying oils, " as they unite readily with oxygen, and so become hard and varnish-like. 
The mineral oils (paraffine oil) do not combine with oxygen at ordinary temperatures, and probably will not cause spontaneous combustion. 
Still, all oily cloths should be burned or disposed of in some safe fashion.

**Military Working Dogs**
2-8. DOD tasks the Army to provide PEDD support for presidential, vice presidential, Secretary of State,
and Secretary of Defense visits throughout the world. Currently, there is not a published formula to
predetermine mission frequencies or requirements for these missions. On average, 40 teams inside the
MACOM support the various missions above. These figures do not include travel or mission preparation
time.

4-6. Use extreme caution when removing an MWD from a suspect. Regain and maintain leash control of
the MWD until he has become calm enough to obey the commands "Heel" and "Stay." Do not release an
MWD if the suspect is out of sight, unless an off-leash building search is authorized. Do not release
MWDs in areas where children are present.

4-7. MWD teams are not used for crowd control or direct confrontation with demonstrators unless the
responsible commander determines it to be absolutely necessary. When it is necessary, dogs are kept on a
short leash to minimize the danger to innocent persons. Dogs are not released into a crowd. Civil
disturbance contingency plans include specific criteria for the use of MWD teams that are consistent with
FM 3-19.15, AR 190-12, and AR 190–14

7-2. PEDD teams may be used for searching internees' belongings or confinement cells. PEDD teams
should not be used to search a person. A PEDD is trained to attack with or without command; any sudden
movements the internee may make could be perceived by the PEDD as an aggressive act. Safety must
remain a priority for both the handler and military personnel.

7-29. PEDD team patrol capabilities may be used at ACPs to search for stowaways and personnel trying to
gain access to the installation or a controlled area by hiding in delivery vehicles or other large cargo type
vehicles. Extreme caution must be used when utilizing the team in this manner. The commander must be
aware that once the PEDD is given the command to search for personnel the potential for injury exists.

8-37. An improvised muzzle can be made using the MWD's leash and is called a leash muzzle. To apply
the leash muzzle, tighten the choke chain on the MWD's neck by pulling the leash tightly with the right
hand. Place the left hand, palm up, under the choke chain on the neck. Grasp the leash tightly as it passes
through the palm of the left hand, wrap the leash once around the MWD's neck, and bring it up and across
the left side of his head. Finally, wrap the leash twice around the muzzle and grab it tightly with the left hand.

ACP = access control point
PEDD = patrol explosive detector dog
MWD = military working dog

**Hazardous Materials Warning**
In using chlorate of potassa the greatest care is necessary. 
It may be powdered and otherwise handled safely when alone, but when combustible mater of any kind is added to it the mixture becomes highly explosive and must be very gently handled. 
It must therefore be powdered separately and only mixed with ingredients after they have been powdered. 
The mixing should be done on a large sheet of paper, very gently, but very thoroughly, with a thin, broad-bladed knife.
